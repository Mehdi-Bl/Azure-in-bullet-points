# Responsibilities (2025)

- Microsoft gives you a secure foundation & tooling to control your environment but customers have the responsibility of their subscription governance, data, identities, and how to protect those.
- The cloud presents a spectrum of responsibilities based on what types of services and/or features a customer may be consuming.
  - This is unlike more traditional on-premises information systems where most, if not all, security is implemented by the same owner.
  - In IaaS, customer owns more control than in PaaS or SaaS.
- The subscription is associated with a Microsoft account or organizational account.

## Azure Solutions Architect Expert Path (2025)

### Current Certification Requirements
To earn the **Azure Solutions Architect Expert** certification, you must pass:

### Exam AZ-305 Overview
- **Duration**: 150 minutes
- **Format**: Multiple choice, scenarios, and case studies
- **Passing Score**: 700/1000

#### Exam Weightings (October 2024 Update)
1. **Design identity, governance and monitoring solutions** (25–30%)
2. **Design data storage solutions** (20–25%)
3. **Design business continuity solutions** (15–20%)
4. **Design infrastructure solutions** (30–35%)

## Shared Responsibility Model (2025)

### IaaS Responsibilities
- **Customer manages**: Operating system, middleware, runtime, data, applications, identity & directory infrastructure, network controls, firewall configuration
- **Microsoft manages**: Virtualization layer, physical security, network, host operating system, physical storage

### PaaS Responsibilities
- **Customer manages**: Applications, data, identity & directory infrastructure (partial)
- **Microsoft manages**: Runtime, operating system, virtualization, network, physical infrastructure

### SaaS Responsibilities
- **Customer manages**: Data, devices
- **Microsoft manages**: Applications, runtime, operating system, virtualization, networking, physical infrastructure

### Serverless Computing
- **Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)**: Customer provides code and data, manages security policies
- **Platform manages**: Runtime, scaling, availability, patching

### Confidential Computing (2025)
- **Data in Use Protection**: AMD SEV-SNP and Intel TDX for VMs
- **Shared Responsibility**: Customer responsible for application security, Microsoft provides hardware isolation

## Zero Trust Architecture (2025)

### Core Principles
- **Never Trust, Always Verify**: Verify every request as if it originates from an open network
- **Least Privilege Access**: Limit user access with just-in-time and just-enough-access (JIT/JEA)
- **Assume Breach**: Minimize blast radius and segment access

### Implementation Layers
1. **Identity**: Microsoft Entra ID, Conditional Access, MFA
2. **Device**: Device compliance, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
3. **Application**: Application gateways, API management
4. **Data**: Encryption, data classification, DLP
5. **Infrastructure**: Network segmentation, Azure Firewall, NSGs
