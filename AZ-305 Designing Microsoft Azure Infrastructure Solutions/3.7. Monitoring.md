- Available through Portal, CLI, PowerShell, Rest API, retrieved using Power BI or third-party logs.
- Events are logged in storage accounts, ready to be sent to Event Hub or Log Analytics.
- Metrics for performance measurements are collected over a period of time.

## Azure Security Center

- Unified security management and advanced threat protection for workloads running in Azure, on-premises, and in other clouds.
- Enables you to discover and assess the security of your workloads and to identify and mitigate risk.
  - E.g. • network recommendations • network maps • internet facing endpoints without NSGs.
- Two tiers: Free and [Azure Defender](#azure-defender)

### Azure Defender

- Formerly known as **Azure Security Center Standard Edition**
- Regulatory compliance dashboard and reports
- Threat protection for
  - Azure VMs and non-Azure servers
  - PaaS services
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (servers)

### Just-in-time (JIT) virtual machine (VM) access

- Can be used to lock down inbound traffic to VMs
- Reduces exposure to attacks while providing easy access to connect to VMs when needed.
- Flow
  1. A user requests access to a VM
  2. Azure Defender checks that the user has Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions that permit them to successfully request access to a VM.
  3. Azure Defender automatically configures the Network Security Groups (NSGs) to allow inbound traffic to the selected ports and requested source IP addresses or ranges, for the amount of time that was specified.
  4. After the time has expired, Azure Defender restores the NSGs to their previous states.
     - Those connections that are already established are not interrupted

## Azure Monitor

- Helps you monitor your applications and resources
- All data connected by Azure Monitor fits into two types: [Logs](#azure-logs), [Metrics](#azure-metrics)
- Log Analytics and Application Insights have been combined into Azure Monitor
  - Log analytics was a product before, now just referred as a feature.
- 🤗 In 2018 "Operations Management Suite (OMS)" and [its services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/terminology#april-2018---retirement-of-operations-management-suite-brand) were rebranded into Azure Monitor and it's no longer available.

### Azure Logs

- Allows you to monitor log data
- Log data can be from on-premises or cloud resources
- Helps maintain resource availability and performance.
- It allows you to run queries and list or visualize results
- Reads data from a [log analytics workspace](#log-analytics-workspace)

#### Log Analytics workspace

- Logical storage unit where log data is collected and stored
- Basic management unit of Azure Monitor Logs
- Retention: min 31 days (default), up to 730 days (paid)
- Supports sending custom logs through
  - [Log Analytics Agent](#log-analytics-agent)
  - [HTTP Data Collector API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/data-collector-api) (previously known as Log Analytics Data Collector API)

##### Queries in Log Analytics workspace

- Allows you to save save queries
- You can filter, sort, group query results or render charts based on them

### Azure Metrics

- Feature of Azure Monitor that collects numeric data
- Save data into a time series database
- **Metrics**
  - Numerical values that are collected at regular intervals
  - Describe some aspect of a system at a particular time
  - Also called performance counters
- There is no need to set up additional diagnostics for metrics, nor opt-in for the data.
- Frequency of one minute.
- Can be viewed on portal using Azure metrics explorer
- Retention is often 93 days
  - ❗️ But only lets you view 30 days at a time
  - Archive metrics to storage for longer retention
    - Can be configured in the settings for the resource.
- **Multi-dimensional metrics**
  - Some metrics can also name-value pair attributes (called dimensions)
  - Allows further segmentation
- Use-cases
  - Track the performance of your resource (such as a VM, website, or logic app) by plotting its metrics on a portal chart and pinning that chart to a dashboard.
  - Perform advanced analytics or reporting on performance or usage trends of your resource.
  - Get notified of an issue that impacts the performance of your resource when a metric crosses a certain threshold.
  - Archive the performance or health history of your resource for compliance or auditing purposes.
  - You can choose to stream this information to an event hub.
    - Doing so allows you to route them to Azure Stream Analytics for near-real-time analysis.
