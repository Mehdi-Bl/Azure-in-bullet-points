# Azure DevOps - Test Plans

- View test cases, runs & results.
- **Test suites**: Groups test cases together for e.g. different scenarios.
- **Test plans**: Groups test suites and test cases.

## Test cases

- Each work item in Azure Boards can have multiple test cases.
  - Create by clicking on  *Add test*
- Each test case consists of multiple steps
  - Each step has an Action, Expected result, and Attachments.
- You can assign the test cases to individual testers
- Run test cases manually
  - In test plan view you can run your tests one by one.
    - You can comment & add screenshots/recording/user actions and create issues & bugs easily.
  - Or you can as passed or failed on directly on Azure Boards
- [Run automated test cases](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/test/run-automated-tests-from-test-hub?view=azure-devops)
  - You can couple test-cases with pipelines and run them automatically through Test

## Load Tests

- See how well your application can behave under certain types of load or stress.
- **Types**:
  - URL-based load tests
  - JMeter test scripts
  - Visual Studio web performance tests
  - HTTP-archive based tests
- **Azure Load Testing (2025 - Enhanced)**:
  - **CI/CD Integration**: Configure test components and metrics directly in pipeline YAML
  - **Pass/Fail Criteria**: Set server-side pass/fail criteria on application metrics
  - **Parameter Overrides**: Override test parameters from pipeline runs
  - **Output Variables**: Pass test results as pipeline variables for downstream tasks
  - **Automatic Cancellation**: Tests automatically cancel when pipeline is cancelled
  - **Test Result Tracing**: Trace test results back to specific pipeline runs from Azure portal
  - **Cross-platform Support**: Run tests from Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions
- **Load Patterns**:
  - **Constant**: Same number of users throughout the test
  - **Step**: Gradually increase users (e.g., start with `x` users, increment by `z` every `y` seconds)
  - **Spike**: Sudden burst of users to test system resilience
- **Configuration**:
  - Duration, maximum users, initial count, warmup time
  - Browser simulation options
  - User agent selection:
    - **Automatically provisioned**: Select geo-location
    - **Self-provisioned**: Use your own test infrastructure
- **Test Results**:
  - Summary reports
  - Performance charts (response time, throughput)
  - Error analysis
  - Test diagnostics and logs
  - Integration with Azure Monitor for metrics visualization

## CI/CD Integration (2025)

- **Pipeline Integration**:
  - Add load testing tasks directly to YAML pipelines
  - Configure test parameters via pipeline variables
  - Use conditions to run load tests on specific branches or schedules
  - Fail pipeline on threshold breaches
- **Test Result Analysis**:
  - View test results in Azure DevOps test hub
  - Export results to Log Analytics for historical analysis
  - Create work items automatically on test failures
  - Link test runs to build and release artifacts
