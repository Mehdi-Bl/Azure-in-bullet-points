# Design a DevOps Strategy

## Greenfield & Brownfield

- Greenfield projects
  - Brand new, lacks any constraints imposed by prior work.
- Brownfield projects
  - Development and deployment of new software systems within the immediate presence of existing (legacy) software applications/services
- Greenfield vs Brownfield Ops

  | Brownfield | Greenfield |
  | ------------|------------|
  | Slow change, but reliable & scalable | Fast change, innovative and more tolerant of bugs |
  | Maintaining workloads across on-premise data centers | Maintaining workloads across externally sourced infrastructures |
  | Not cloud platform enabled | Cloud platform enabled |
  | Waterfall release cycles | Agile development cycles |
  | Legacy, monolithic tools | New, composable tools |
  | Legacy, serial processes | New, collaborative processes |

## Project Metrics and KPIs

- Faster Outcomes
  - **Deployment Frequency**
    - Increasing the frequency of deployments is often a critical driver in DevOps projects.
  - **Deployment Speed**
    - As well as increasing how often deployments happen, it's important to decrease the time that they take.
  - **Deployment Size**
    - How many features, stories, and bug fixes are being deployed each time?
  - **Lead Time**
    - How long does it take from starting on a work item, until it is deployed?
- Efficiency
  - **Server to Admin Ratio**
    - Are the projects reducing the number of administrators required for a given number of servers?
  - **Staff Member to Customers Ratio**
    - Is it possible for less staff members to serve a given number of customers?
  - **Application Usage**
    - How busy is the application?
  - **Application Performance**
    - Is the application performance improving or dropping? (Based upon application metrics)?
- Quality and Security
  - **Deployment Failure Rates**
    - How often do deployments (and/or applications) fail?
  - **Application Failure Rates**
    - How often do application failures occur, such as configuration failures, performance timeouts, etc?
  - **Mean Time to Recover**
    - How quickly can you recover from a failure?
  - **Bug Report Rates**
    - You don't want customers finding bugs in your code.
    - Is the amount they are finding increasing or decreasing?
  - **Test Pass Rates**
    - How well is your automated testing working?
  - **Defect Escape Rate**
    - What percentage of defects are being found in production?
  - **Availability**
    - What percentage of time is the application truly available for customers?
  - **SLA Achievement**
    - Are you meeting your service level agreements (SLAs)?
  - **Mean Time to Detection**
    - If there is a failure, how long does it take for it to be detected?
- Culture
  - **Employee Morale**
    - Are employees happy with the transformation and where the organization is heading?
    - Are they still willing to respond to further changes?
  - **Retention Rates**
    - Is the organization losing staff?
- Lead time vs. cycle time

## Workflow and Traceability - **UPDATED 2025**

### GitHub Flow and Azure Boards Integration

- **GitHub Flow**: Modern workflow emphasizing continuous deployment
  - Create feature branches from main
  - Make commits with clear, descriptive messages
  - Open pull requests for review
  - Merge to main after approval
  - Deploy immediately to production

- **GitHub Issues/Projects Integration**:
  - Configure integrations between GitHub repositories and Azure Boards
  - Implement webhooks for automatic notifications and updates
  - Use GitHub Projects for sprint planning and backlog management
  - Enable cross-system traceability for work items

### New Boards Hub (Azure Boards) - **NEW 2025**

- **Markdown Support**: Work item comments now support Markdown formatting
  - Consistent documentation across platforms
  - Convert existing comments to Markdown for better formatting
  - Preview requires the New Boards Hub activation
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Improved UI for work item management and reporting
- **Integration Features**: Better connectivity with GitHub and Teams

## Metrics and Dashboards - **ENHANCED 2025**

### Key DevOps Metrics

- **DORA Metrics** (Industry Standard):
  - **Deployment Frequency**: How often code is deployed to production
  - **Lead Time**: Time from commit to production deployment
  - **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**: Time to recover from failures
  - **Change Failure Rate**: Percentage of deployments causing failures

- **Additional Metrics**:
  - **Cycle Time**: Time from work item start to completion
  - **Throughput**: Number of work items completed in a period
  - **Flow Efficiency**: Time value-added vs. total cycle time
  - **Flow Load**: Work items in progress
  - **Flow Velocity**: Story points or tasks completed per sprint

### Dashboard Implementation

- **Azure Monitor Workbooks**: Create interactive dashboards with telemetry data
- **Power BI Integration**: Connect to Azure DevOps and GitHub for advanced analytics
- **GitHub Insights**: Built-in metrics for repository and workflow analysis
- **Custom Queries**: Use Kusto Query Language (KQL) for custom metric analysis

### Best Practices

- Implement real-time dashboards for immediate feedback
- Use SLOs (Service Level Objectives) and SLIs (Service Level Indicators)
- Automate metric collection through CI/CD pipelines
- Set up alerts for threshold breaches
