# Introduction

## DevOps

### What

- Misconceptions
  - It fits every organization
  - It can be applied to any application lifecycle process
  - Leads to failure when it comes to implementing DevOps
- As per Wikipedia:
  - > Set of software development practices
    - So it's not a software or application
    - It's not set of tools, even though tools are important
    - It's a practice where an organization needs to be mature enough to develop & follow the practice
  - > Combines software development (Dev), information technology operations (Ops)
    - 💡 Do not separate them but combine them!
    - **Maturity**: Departments must be mature enough to work together.
      - Most common blocker.
  - > Shortens development lifecycle, while delivering features, fixes, updates frequently in close alignment with business objectives.

### Why

- **Automation**: that all organizations go towards
  - Changes onto applications
  - Delivery of releases
  - Creation of the infrastructure
- **Agility**: How fast you deliver your changes to customer
- **Customer satisfaction**: Based on how fast you deliver
- **Quality** through more automation
- **Delivery** with more value
