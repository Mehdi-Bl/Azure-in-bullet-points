## 📝 Choose a process

| Name | When to choose | Hierarchy | Separate items |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Basic Process | Need for the simplest model | Epic (in Portfolio backlog) 🠚 issue (in Product backlog) 🠚 task | ␀ |
| Agile Process | Need for an agile process e.g. Scrum, can track user stories, bugs, development, test activities | Epic (in Portfolio backlog) 🠚 feature 〖🠚 user story (in Backlog) 🠚 task (in Backlog)〗 OR 〖bug (in Backlog) 🠚 task (in Backlog)〗 | issue |
| Scrum process | Need to align with Scrum | Same as agile but product backlog item instead of user story | impediment for issue & bug tracking |
| CMMI Process | Need to follow more formal project process | Same as agile but feature instead of user story | change request, issue, review, risk |

- 🤗 Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) is framework to move towards an more agile approach.
  - defines the following maturity levels for processes: Initial, Managed, Defined, Quantitatively Managed, and Optimizing.
